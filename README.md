# weather-dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that pulls from a weather api to display the current weather as well as the current five day forecast for the coming week. The searched cities you enter will be saved locally and displayed underneath the search bar for quick access. This project was a good challenge and I enjoyed the process a lot. Thank you for checking it out and I hope you enjoy.
